# Predict Fare of Airline Tickets using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict the fare of airline tickets using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors such as flight duration, departure time, airline, and route, the model predicts the fare price with a certain degree of accuracy. The project utilizes a dataset containing historical flight data to train and test the machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of historical flight data, including features such as:
- Airline
- Date of Journey
- Source and Destination
- Departure and Arrival Times
- Flight Duration
- Number of Stops
- Additional Information

## Approach

The following steps outline the approach taken in this project:

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.

2. Feature Selection: Select relevant features that have the most impact on the fare price prediction.

3. Model Selection: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc., to determine the best-performing model.

4. Model Training: Train the selected machine learning model on the preprocessed dataset.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected model to optimize performance further.

7. Prediction: Deploy the trained model to predict the fare price of airline tickets for new data instances.

## Dependencies

The project is implemented in Python and utilizes the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- etc.

Ensure that these dependencies are installed in your environment to run the project successfully.

## Usage

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Execute the Python scripts in the `src` directory to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate additional features such as weather data, airline popularity, holidays, etc., to improve prediction accuracy.
- Explore advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods, deep learning, etc., for better performance.
- Implement a web application or API for users to input flight details and obtain fare predictions in real-time.
